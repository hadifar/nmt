Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain diseases because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you will definitely develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you will develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagnosed with a a certain genetic diseases , are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On the the one hand we do not want this potential danger having frightening effects on our families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we have have have a a certain diseases , their attitudes will easily change , whether it be it be caring for about about us too much or keeping away from us .
And both are not what we want , since most of us just want to live as normal people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we will be too distracted and worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
On the other hand , if there are things that can help us to control or cure the disease , we can go through this processes with the whole family .
For example , if exercise is helpful reducing a a potential family disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to do exercise .
so we can keep track of all family members ' health .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members who have who have who have got this  disease .
Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has a moral obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there is currently no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .

Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If a a a a a certain is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and to make it to make it tell others , it is OK to disclose results results
Above all , life is more important than secrecy .
Genetic risk does carry consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
After all what affects one family may or may not affect another , , even though families have a common genetic make-up , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing it it or otherwise to his or her relatives is solely a matter of preference within the individual moral code .
The issue of the right to know or not to know is highly debatable . . Although there is a genetic risk , one can not be entirely sure because the genetic information could possibly come from the family of either parent - their maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousins .
This also means that as soon as as as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurrently has knowledge about the others .
This knowledge may be relevant to them or not .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
Does the people who suffer from this disease keep it a secret or inform their relatives ?
In retrospect , it is also one 's duty to ensure that they undergo periodic health checks of their own .
Sometimes the family structures and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on who the genetic risk was discovered in : the son or daughter , , for example , the parentparent who know about this would decide who gets told and who takes precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
For example , within the family , regardless of who first receives the information , parents are seen as having the primary responsibility for passing on the information to any offspring or , at risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by the individual 's response to risk information as they might may might not want to know .
Hence , there are also tensions if the participants feel that they can neither pass on the information to the relatives who need to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extends 'vertically' .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on the information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective , these findings are important because , if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct , , they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must draw attention to those who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at-risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal morals and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
People with a close blood relationships generally carry some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry a a genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell their close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk so that their family members are able to do some daily exercises to prevent the potential disease or they may go to the the hospital and check for the corresponding flows .
In my opinion , although the disclosure of carrying genetic risk involves the issue of personal privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
I will focus on the negative side of disclosure genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with genetic risk would want to keep it a secret as the genetic risk may indicate a high chance of carrying certain diseases .
This is especially the case for young people who are unmarried . If unmarried who are known to have some genetic risk , there may be a a chance that his/her child will carry the same disease , but this is this is not certain .
Therefore , to keep the information a secret from his/her future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , the potential risk would cause the family members to be scared of this issue . Although the factor might not be that serious , people would still fear that they will have some potential diseases in the future ; , and so , go to the the hospital and do additional checks or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creates unnecessary costs for the family .
Furthermore , the disclosure of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as , sometimes , others may not want to stay too close to the carrier , so that they have less chance of getting the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help to protect their privacy , it has much greater negative impacts on the family members and relatives .
First , in the case of marriage , a person should be honest and tell their spouse they may carry a a certain genetic risk that might affect their offspring .
It is better to let the other party know the facts , rather than wait until after the baby is born and a a certain types of genetic disease are found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the birth gene together with their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that he/she has a risk of having diabetes .
In this case , the carrier could eat fewer candies and chocolates to prevent taking in too much sugar , and at the same time , if the carrier tells this information to relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future because of related genes , , and they can do the same exercise to take in less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties do not know , they may end up having diabetes in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , we can see that the benefits of disclosing the genetic risk to the carrier 's relatives outweigh the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to give the information to relatives in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercise .
Like large number of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic factors .
Genetic disorders may or may not be hereditary diseases and it is sometimes hard to find out whether one has these kinds of diseases .
There is a long-standing debate about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by a genes .
Legally , the answer is no but , ethically , the answer should be yes .
We can not pass a law to compel a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell their relatives about their genetic problem .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , what kinds of diseases someone has is a matter or personal privacy .
Privacy belongs to one 's human rights .
If a law requires someone to tell others their private details , especially when they are not willing to do so .
it is against their human rights and it is against the spirit of the law .
The spirit of the law also includes fairness .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorders and other disorders ?
It is unfair to pass a law which only pertaining to genetic disorders .
In addition , it is impractical to pass such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to enforce .
However , there are many problems with asking the carrier to tell his or her relatives the cause of his or her disease .
Firstly , what is the range of relatives ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell their direct relatives , like parents and brothers and sisters , or do they also need to tell relatives like their grandmothers sisters sons daughters and ?
If you say they needs to tell direct relatives , it will be against the law .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities of developing this disease .
How can a law passed by the government exclude such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease ?
However , from the ethical point of view ,
the carrier should have a feeling of responsibility to tell their relatives about their genetic disorder .
By doing this ,they may be able to save the lives of their relatives .
This is because a carrier with a bad genes may not necessarily develop the genetic diseases if they can have a healthy lifestyle before the age that the genes ' function becomes stronger .
A typical example is genetically caused by hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make it it harder for the carrier to digest the fat and salt in the blood .
People usually get this kind of hypertension when they are adults .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have a greater possibility of getting hypertension ,
they can adopt a daily habit of eating less salt and fat and thus avoid hypertension .
, our society can not compel genetic problem carriers to tell about their relatives about their disease but they should be willing to tell their relatives about their genetic problem .
If they do so , fewer of their loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In an age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo .
It is able to detect illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
However , it might become a controversial issue or is a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk whether whether to inform his or her relatives .
If the knowledge of genetic risk is shared with the family or relatives , there might be chances for them to have it in their blood also also which may force them to take the necessary precautions .
But , if the genetic disease is a terminal disease , most relatives will be disheartened upon learning about it .
Therefore , some carriers will prefer to keep it a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some say that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered personal information which should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be depressed after finding out about their condition .
If someone has a genetic disease , after the test , they might not wish to inform their relatives as they might end up disheartening their extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring any pessimism into their family .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden to anyone , as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some see it as being considerate to keep the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it is considerate to tell their relatives , because the latter will have a higher chance of having the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to take some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it depends on what kind of genetic disease , in the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is detected in the early stages .
Hence , with the knowledge of having a genetic risk , the relatives of someone with a person with person with genetic disease will have a medical check-up , which might aid them by detecting it at an earlier stage .
In conclusion , it would be considerate to inform relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way when seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right to know their family 's inherited medical conditions .
However , some may think that it might be better for relatives to remain ignorant of it because they will continue leading a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about a a risk of disease will just add to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
All-in-all , it depends on the individuals and also the nature of the disease , but people should be obligated to inform their relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing the condition .
Having genetic testing can cause a difficult personal decision because a patient can be given made the knowledge that there is a possiblity that he or she could be a carrier .
Those who are born in a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing . to be sure that there is no risk at all .
Early pre-examination is preferable as it will remove unwanted doubts but will affect the thinking of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
They should not be forced or obliged to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to the choice , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of choice .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor , then most likely the decision about informing the relatives should be made by the patient 's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of the genetic disorders due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent of their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to be be be put into the immediate family , as it could cause a chaos of unwanted events for the patient or the family members .
Some families members may feel hurt with regards to their family pride or reputation on receiving the knowledge of a genetic disorder running in their family .
However , they have a to play and a responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other members in the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of a genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevent of the genetic disorder .
Also , this information will help relatives to make informed decisions and to similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about them .
Thus , having the knowledge that the genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial to their emotional health .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and this may this will aid them in making decisions in the future .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it has been made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital as they assure that the genetic risk carrier is not alone in facing this illness , and it will certainly provide a morale boost , , as the whole family will share a common feeling with regards to the future prospects of the genetic disorder , , which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of a genetic disorders will be dependent on the situation and background of the affected family . freedom about
A person with a disorder , whether it be a whether it is a mental or physical disorder , , is happy to be cared for by his or her family .
When it comes to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder inheritance is from generation to generation , but not all of the offspring shows the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family with a risk of potential genetic disorder may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members display any observable symptoms .
As a result , when one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or abnormal , he or she should be be be aware of the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterwards the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is whether whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives .
If the disorder symptoms are discovered in a child , the parents will be informed by the medics , then the whole family will be alert to their body 's condition .
In contrast , if the carrier is an adult and is responsible their to choose whether to inform their relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
One might think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves their family more than themself , there is no doubt that they will tell their family about the issue .
That is true and , of course , it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Let 's us look at another possibility : if a child in the family knows that he has the risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might be passed by his children in the future , he will be in a dilemma his whole life .
Thus , he or she will think of not having any children after getting married , and the same thought occurs to cousins as well .
As a result , the family line stops the moment the adult carrier announces his problem .
In China , the older generation with a traditional cultural backgrounds will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren to make the family increase and grow grow stronger .
The underlying underlying reason is that after WWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encouraged people to have more children .
During that period , if one of the family members was affected by genetic disorder symptoms , he would fall into an ethical dilemma .
The medical technology at that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He had to choose to protect his family and make his family more prosperous despite a potential genetic risk .
So , he would have chosen not to undergo genetic disorder testing and to to let the truth be buried forever .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duties of the provider in the family .
In conclusion people should think carefully about what the consequences are of telling the relatives about about their genetic disorder .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to add to the family .
Even if the disorder is unlikely fatal or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
One of the reasons is that , as a carrier , she or he needs moral support to go through this situation .
It would hard for an individual to deal with the issue on their own .
If they tell their family , other than being a support , they could possibly help them to find alternative solutions to the problem that they are facing there and then .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it would better for the carrier to inform his or her family , as other family members might experience the same thing .
If they are made aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up and would they could even prevent it from happening to them .
I think that it is important to family members , especially if it is contagious . The carrier could prevent the disease from spreading to society .
For every decision , there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some carriers will choose not to reveal their disease to family members , as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even to feel ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could involve spending lot of money on treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden to their family .
I can understand the feelings of the carrier .
She or he does not want to be a source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effect will arise when the carrier decides to tell his or her family about his or her condition .
In conclusion , personally , I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform their family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest about his or her feelings , and I think that it is the right of the family members to know what is going on in his or her life .
If anything bad happens in the carrier 's life without their having informed the family members , , it could cause huge regret in their life if they leave without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions to their problem with the family members , as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on their own .
Finally , I believe that support , whether mental or financial , form from his or her family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
There , are lots of cancer patients who are given a a second chance to live as normal people because they had strong moral support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our minds healthy and strong , we can fight any disease , , because they come to us even if we are fragile and weak .
As technology has advanced , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual use of technology
Genetic testing has been made possible ; it is easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness . However , it could also make a situations worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives , and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so , because I believe that he or she has a the right not to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
Of course , some people may do it to make their future slightly happier . However , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live with the uncertainty that the gene holds and is is willing to accept it , he can do that , and it was something that was 'normal ' for everyone in the past , as genetic testing was not possible .
It could even be better for him or her that way .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention against giving birth to disabled offspring and making them suffer in real life .
I personally think this is the right purpose of going through genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled child does not have to give birth to their children and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has a the right not to be obligated to tell anyone , but has a responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
If the results turns out to be to be to be something that the carrier could not accept , , then it would have been better not to know the truth .
I also believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the facts .
After he or she realizes that he or she is the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family and cause more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it is entirely up to the carrier whether whether to share the hard facts and face it with relatives , , but he still has no obligation to tell .
In fact , I strongly believe that the carrier should weigh the positive and negative consequences of undergoing genetic test and take the appropriate action based on the results .
The trauma that the carrier might suffer and the sense of guilt could be more than expected and could be a burden for his life .
On the other hand , without knowing of about any genetic disorder and having to accept the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome any disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years : as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives ?
Any individual at risk of a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be disclosed to others , especially close family or distant relatives , is a topic is worth discussing .
This is an that that needs to be addressed a a family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
In this essay , a some arguments will be put forward in support the any carrier of a known genetic risk telling his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
We were crying hard but we were not alone . It is our family that bring us up .
Hence , they are people we should be grateful for and the people we would like to share joy with .
However , in the case of any health issues or to the extent of a serious disorders , there may seem no point in sharing , , , but this involves more than just the the the sharing of bad news .
One definitely has the right not to disclose one 's health issues to anyone , but it is one 's responsibility to inform family ,
If a is related to genetic risk , with the the emphasis on " genetic " , this highlights the risk of passing on the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree that obligatory a carrier of a a a a known genetic risk should should tell his or her relatives , , , to avoid any family-related ethical dilemmas that could arise in the future .
Although one may argue that it is up to the individual whether to decide to decide to disclose such a a health issues or to keep it to , it is certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion about solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressed in facing such a health .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
As a result of informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle with such a a health risk .
On top of that , the genetic risk may pass down to the the the next generation , so it will involve more than one family .
Therefore I would agree with the obligation to tell the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and has a plan for raising a family .
This would prevent the incidence of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
There are more intangible advantages that could support informing the relatives once the results are known after the test is has been conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid family-related ethical dilemmas , it is best for a carrier of a a known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
The benefits of doing so outweigh the disadvantages .
More support must be provided through different means to give better guidance when someone is deliberating whether they inform their relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk of a disorder .
This is the common law in society .
However , it leads to a new problem : can be summarised as " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
" This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is still a diversity of points of view among people .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentence below : " I would be anxious about my family member if he or she tells me that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
Frequently , the reason for the carriers is to tell their family , to continue their own lives without anxiety their their .
It is obvious that it is better for one person to be worried than many .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges .
With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight the demon .
The demon is not easily defeated and much energy is required requires a lot and psychological support .
Families give you the courage and support which you can not find by yourself .
That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Besides that , the risk of the known disorder is so serious that it can not be described .
The seriousness can be bigger than our imagination .
Lying on a bed for your rest of your days , or even dying quickly : these are consequences which we can not imagine .
Families are the dearest people people in our lives .
Without their concern and support , it find it hard to stay alive alive for a long time .
They play an important role in our lives which can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk can also critically affect the next generation .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell our relatives , to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's family without the agreement of the the carrier .
It is the ethic of hospital staff a hospitals to keep the secret of patients .
We can not blame them if they are liable for undesired consequences .
However , the hospitals can provide a counsellor to advise the carrier about the action that that that can be taken .
Therefore , these kinds of circumstance will not happen again and again .
It is a method that benefits the two which , , which is a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to define .
Thus , advice from the hospital plays an important role in .
The carrier is responsible for balancing his or her own interests and the benefits to the family and even society .
It is a hard decision to make but by choosing the most appropriate behaviour , great circumstances for the carrier and their families will be created in the future . .
With the risk of genetic disorders , many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing .
With the knowledge that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed as being a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical dilemma : should they warn their relatives about the risk of being a carrier of the same genetic risk ?
Or should they choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed ?
From my point of view , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , for the following reasons .
First of all , from the point of view of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a private matter to carriers .
They may not want the truth to influence their lives and want to keep it a secret and not let let let let others know about it .
This is reasonable since exposure of the truth of being a carrier may cause them to to to be discriminated against against against against against or pitied by others , , , , which are not positive factors in their lives .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to undergo genetic testing , regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to ask about it .
If they do not want to think too much about it and view it as a problem , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher risk of being genetic risk carriers .
This forces them wishes to accept the truth , , which may make the rest of their life miserable .
Many people may argue that establishing an obligation may help more people who are the relatives of carriers save their lives because of early diagnosis .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors , including psychological influence and social influence , are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have a a a higher risk of getting sick , he or she may be scared about the future ; partners , spouses and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other difficulties may emerge , which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
In summary , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted from the point of view of view of view of human rights , the freedom of acceptance of relatives , and for many other social factors .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
For a carrier of a a a genetic disorder , , , , knowing that he or she is a carrier causes more difficulty than getting the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
There are four reasons why people should n't be scared and should should share their problems regarding a genetic disorder .
Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions : physically , through actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited by offspring ; ; and , mentally , , , if the action fails to prevent it being inherited .
Many syndromes , , such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome , , can be prevented from happening if the mother undergoes proper medication and does not consume anything anything harmful during the pregnancy period .
This information may not be known by the mother if she does not tell her relatives about her condition .
The more people ( relatives ) that about her problem , the the bigger the information channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome , , , the family has to accept the fact and do whatever it can to provide a good environment for its children 's growth .
This is not the parents ' fault because there are still a chance of the gene being inherited .
So , they also have to prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases cost a great deal for treatment and medication .
Albinism is an example .
People with albinism have sensitive skin and this needs regular treatment .
Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do not treat their body well , for example , by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen outdoors , there is a good chance that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medical costs are very expensive .
To prevent the bigger problem from happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the carrier does not tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of these diseases is sickle cell anaemia .
Usually , , people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problems such as blood clotting .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and discloses the information to their relatives , , , they can take their children to undergo genetic testing and need not not be scared about because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Fourthly , it is important for the parents to give a a mental encouragement to their children with a genetic disorders
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
Strangers and friends often mock their condition .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and by the closest people .
If not their family , , , who else is willing to do that ?
It is not a difficult job for the family if they have prepared mentally first by disclosing the information about the probability that their children may suffer from a genetic disorder .
In this modern world , technology has significantly improved compared to the last century .
Particularly in the medical field , there has been great improvement in treatments for many formerly incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which are used to diagnose whether an individual is at risk of a genetic disorder .
The medical authorities claim that only the individual who is at risk of a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives about it .
This is because their relatives have the right to know .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be passed on to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members being at risk of a genetic disorder which means that other family members also have equal same risk of having it . So this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Every family member has the right to know what is going on with them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk of a genetic disorder , how can this demonstrate their right ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk of a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James , about this .
Although telling James about this is horrible , he should know what is to happen to with him .
It might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the same genetic disorder , preventing certain genetic disorders from affecting them .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on them .
In addition , doctors usually cite a dictum , " Prevention is better than cure " , and this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing it , and therefore , this may make prevention of a certain disorder possible .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who are are are aware of having a a disorder can prevent it happening by adopting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and having at least 30 minutes of exercise exercising every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives .
It is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder from developing .
Together with the advancement of technology over the recent decades,medical progress has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly being added . Empowered with advanced medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and carry out genetic testing for patients to help prevent illness illness illness illness and take the the the necessary steps to protect their life.However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known,the question of disclosing the results to relatives becomes a challenging issue for both the the patient and doctor.I a support the obligation to inform patients ' relatives .
As it is a genetic risk,the patient 's 's 's 's next-of-kin might have a high chance of carrying the risk . Hence , the need to inform relatives is important so that the necessary preventive measures can be taken before unforeseen circumstances arise.For example,if you are the only child in a family and , unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease , , , , the genetic trait might be passed on to the next generation if you have a child . Hence by making your family members aware of the situation,you might lessen the family pressure and suffering forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethical issues like discrimination and privacy are the the the the biggest concerns forcing patients or doctors to disclose the the information to patients ' ' ' ' relatives.These challenge confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal to disclose the the information to relatives ; it is up to the patient what they wish . . . .Early disclosure to family members brings a a a positive reaction and facilitates facilitates facilitates prevention . As in the case of Angelina Jolie , who chose to disclose the information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I can still recall her reason for disclosing her own story ; It . It . It was that she did not want to live in the shadow of cancer .
However,there are still people who are against the decision to reveal private information.As in the case of Alzheimer 's patients,it is the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret how and to to to whom should 's be disclosed to minimise the the potential negative impact on family members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations that who that provide help to Alzheimer 's 's patients , , like the the the Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .However , there are still thousands of people with people with genetic diseases out there that might not be receiving help and support from these organizations . Therefore need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is the that patients need in their difficult time .
In conclusion,the state should pass a legal bill to provide information to doctors detailing to what extent a doctor should to inform relatives ' about the genetic disease and in which situations it should be left to the the the patient 's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage them the creation of assistance schemes to offer the necessary help to patients to encourage them to open up to their own benefit and for that of family members.Although there may be challenges from social ethical issues,in the long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measures to protect their own health and that of that of their loved ones .
Nowadays , studies in the field of genetics are going further and further due to high velocity of technological advancement .
Not long ago , the human genome project , sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) , was started .
In addition , in the field of genetic testing , , people can find about the risk of a possible genetic disorder , as the technology is very advanced already . an even more popular topic arises .
While most people agree that each individual has the right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands on whether it is the patient 's responsibility to share the result with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the patients who are carriers of some known genetic risk should share the truth with their family members .
It is a social obligation to be responsible for the lives of other people .
For the whole society , it is a duty .
Take H1N1 as an example . All the people in Singapore , , including students at school , travelers at Changi Airport , workers in the offices as well as pedestrians on the street , , , are forced by law to take their temperature and report the results to the relevant government authority in charge .
For those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other with no doubts .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to tell family members about the risks of genetic disorder , , both as a social responsibility and as to conserve the family .
Moreover , telling family members the truth is the fastest and the easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' lives are no better than death .
Family members are the closest groups of people from whom patients can get comfort and help are them to successfully get over any possible problems as a result of genetic disorder .
A study by New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members around generally recover 2-4 days faster than those taken care of of by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may give rise to some unnecessary doubts and panic which will endanger family harmony .
However , every family needs go through this kind of troublesome situation . The more problems a family has gone through together , the greater the the bond that will be between the family members as well as the greater the amount of trust , love and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member truly believes in each other and loves each other ,all these problems are just tests to make them stronger .
In the words of  Kelly Clarkson , what does not kill you makes you stronger .
Being in an an Asian society , , where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
The courage to take the genetic test and to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have something may result in people being judgmental while , actually , it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's genes that are affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information .
Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk . I would like to suggest to the person at least shares the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) , since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will be most likely judge or at least discriminate against those who have genetic diseases , since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird' .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to others such as Bubble-Boy disease , autism or Down 's syndrome .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
While we do know that we should not discriminate against against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without their realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives about their having a risk of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand fair and similar treatment to others and , therefore , it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently . Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and , therefore , they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person is the only one suffering from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family , since his family may either become paranoid or judge him and act differently .
Especially when it is just a risk . The option is really his , since he is not an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk , since some of them may be affected . While I do think that this view has some validity , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case .
Maybe we can trust our immediate family members , , but can we really trust all other relatives ?
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person whether tell relatives about it .
However , as I mentioned earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell his or her future partner about the potential risk , since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be a possibility that both the husband and wife are carriers , and , therefore , they should not have any children since their children may not be able to survive after they are born .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters . Therefore , although no one is obliged to tell anyone about their genetic risk , they should be encouraged to disclose their future partner .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives about his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own genes and he has the full rights
He may have different considerations such as disclosing to those who might judge or it may making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell his relatives , but no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right to say that he must tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the improvements in technology , a new life with a genetic risk can be detected .
Genetic risk risk refers to to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore , an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives need be informed that their children have a a a genetic risk .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk .
The child with a a geneticc risk may not have the ability to work , or to have a family and most of the time they are not accepted by the majority .
They may not be be to enjoy the life normal life people enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to care for their child if he/she is not able to look after himself/herself .
The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy burden called medical fees .
Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can take care of a new life that is not able to work and may suffer pain for their entire life .
The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for the nation 's good .
There are always newspaper reports that a new born baby has been abandoned at the hospital after parents realized the baby had diseases that need a huge amount of money to treat .
For countries like Singapore , this is a problem because , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled such as through medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them .
Without an increasing numbers of disabled people in a nation , the government is able to concentrate on developing in other directions like the the military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have a responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world we are living in today , many abortions are occur in hospital every day .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
Therefore , , I believe that the parents have the right to know about about the health of their child .
Many people may support the theory that all person has the right to enjoy the world , especially people with religion .
However , the problem is , will people really enjoy their lives if they have to stay in the hospital every day and with all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what is best for their children , so they will make the right decision after they have been informed .
Also , human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent this tragedy from happening .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
A person should have full control of their information and it their right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else .
When a couple are going to have babies , they run a few tests and see whether they could be some genetic diseases .
The results are disclosed to the husbands and wives .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason of those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
They have a right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling them the results can allow them to to greatly reduce the cost of multiple testing .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
If a a person has a disease C that might be the result of gene A .
He can run a test and find out that he has the gene AA .
This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at a high risk of having a disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having a disease C. If he runs a test and finds out that he has the gene Aa ,
this means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can somehow be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
A person can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives : so , if there is no serious consequence of telling them , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
They might also choose to hint to to to or encourage their relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about the the negative consequences that come about when they disclose their genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that they might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
If a person is obliged to tell his/her relatives , he or she might be discriminated against by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very serious disease ,
after he takes the test , he is obliged to tell his relatives ; everyone will knows that he is a carrier .
So , if all the married couples run a test and find out they are not carriers , they might subconsciously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
Thirdly , it is hard to define relatives .
If a gene runs in the family , and one of the family members tests positive . Whom does he need to tell .
If it is a big family , is he obliged to tell everyone ?
Spouses usually have very close relationships . If person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needs to run a test because his nephew has this disease .
However , wife D is not even at risk of having this disease .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
In less than a week , , half of the town knows person A has a risk gene , and his family might have a genetic at risk .
Nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of one 's information , especially when the party that one is obliged to disclose one 's information to is a potentially large group ( relatives ) .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Nowadays , people not only pursue the comfort of their own lives but also the better development of future generations .
Since the technology of modern society is so advanced , it has become possible for people to make a decisions to take genetic tests so as to be clear whether or not they carry a a genetic risk , which could affect the next generation .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is whether people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk .
In my opinion , the responsibility to tell family and relatives is quite obvious .
And there are two basic reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your own health and the health of your relatives , and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
Your relatives ' awareness of your genetic risk is good for your own health and the health of your relatives .
This is because if you are carrying that genetic risk , there is a a great possibility that your relatives , like parents or siblings , are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have not undergone genetic testing , it is just fate what will happen to both you and your relatives .
However , if you have undergone a test tests and found out that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to have checks regularly .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared to fight the disease and even preventing getting the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also responsible towards your future generation by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth a , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Being the parent , you are being responsible towards your next generation , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on from generation to generation and are aware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a choice about whether to have a a child .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed to such an advanced level , it might be possible in the future that the possibility of altering genes is perfected and widely used . and You can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
In my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing genetic testing in the first place .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone genetic testing and are aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself and your future generations to tell your relatives and family the truth .
To tell or not to tell ?
Consider the case . We decide to undergo genetic testing and found out
we find out that we actually are a genetic risk carrier .
Then it becomes a dilemma whether we need to tell our relatives , who may carry this genetic risk as well .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we make may have a huge impact on their whole lives .
As a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives if we really care about their health status .
For example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disease .
Once we find out we are carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members , because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less food containing sugar and keeping a good mood .
And it is important for the young people .
The earlier we tell them , the it will be for the rest of their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic testing as well to see whether they are carrying or not , which is also better for them .
However , some people may ask why should we want to interfere with their lives ?
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they are going to find out that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like a blood disease which is untreatable .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may contract some disease in the future : kind of feelings would you have ?
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on anything .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct , , which means that they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing . So , actually , , we are bringing them trouble .
Personally , I feel that we should still accept responsibility to tell them the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to do it in a positive way .
We can not let it go .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future .
Only after we tell them that they start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to have a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to prevent their baby carrying this genetic risk as well .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones . We need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to their relatives .
Genetic testing is conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to the patient 's relatives has caused controversy .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and that privacy should be protected .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
This essay will illustrate this two ways .
First of all , it can be a warning to the family members of the patient and make them aware of the possible diseases that they may also have .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass on the genes to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying a faulty genes , other members of his or her family may also have a risk of disease .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Therefore , telling relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble and save a lot of time for proper treatment .
Sometimes , lives may even be saved if they are told early and undergo timely treatment .
So , for the sake of the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic diseases being passed to the next generation if they intend to have babies .
They should let their spouse know about their situation before marriage .
They need to ask for a doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls ; some vice versa .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may be at a risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a real story in a newspaper years ago .
A couple in China had a son of 5 years old .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosed with a kind of genetic disease which is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and could pass it only to boys rather than girls .
Therefore , their son had inherited the genetic disease .
However , the wife actually had known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband .
The son died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced after that .
If the wife had not hidden the truth and had asked for a a doctor 's advice before they had a baby , the tragedy would not have happened .
In summary , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
First , it can tell members of the carrier 's family about the possible disease they may have and they they can undergo treatment in time , if possible .
Second , if the carrier hides the truth , they may pass the disease on to the next generation .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do genetic testing .
We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face a disorder problem .
However , I think that genetic information is a person 's personal private information which should be protected by law .
Therefore , a person with a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
There are three reasons .
Firstly , the information concerning genes is something personal which is also private matter like people 's PINs .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission , even if they are his or her family or relatives .
The government should establish a law to protect this kind of privacy .
Once people 's genetic information is told to other people ,
they may know about the person 's potential disability , disease .
They may discriminate against this person or even abandon him or her .
People do not have the ability to choose their genes , they should not be thought of badly of because of a a bad gene .
So , I think whatever the genetic situation risk situation is or whether the gene matches with their parents , it should not be told to anyone , , even family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family or even break the relationship between children and and adults .
Once his or her family or relatives know , the person may not have anymore contact with them .
However happy they were before , there would be some barriers which would truly gradually destroy the family .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested in terms of genetics ; it is something much deeper and stronger .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children . Meanwhile , they feel happy in the company of the children .
The children rely on on the parents to live .
When they grow up , they will take care of their old parents and thank them them for their dedication .
The relationship between parents and children is about love and dedication .
No one wants to see the scene of a broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Finally , the technology of testing the genes is not very mature at this moment .
There also exists some probability of testing errors .
If the testing errors were not found by the doctor , the parents and the children may be sad and have a struggle for the rest of their lives lives .
Therefore , I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives
More and more illnesses have been discovered to be related to genes through the development of medical technology .
People will know None whether they carry a disease in their genes after they have undergone the genetic test .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure that they do not carry any diseased genes .
Therefore , once people find out they are carrying the diseased genes , it is their responsibility to tell their relatives , or at least their close family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from one family and have the same forefathers , so of course they have the same genes to some extent .
Therefore , there is nothing to be shy about or afraid of .
If a person tells his or her relatives that they are carrying a diseased gene , their relatives can go to the the hospital to check whether they have also got a diseased gene .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease .
They can also , , prevent the disease being passed on to their offspring .
If the relatives are carrying the diseased gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help . They will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or she is married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he/she is carrying the a diseased gene .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of doctors .
Or else , if he hides the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and that may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
There is a story I watched on TV .
A couple did not have a child after being married for a long time . so Their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to the hospital to check what the problem was .
After he coming back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he was carrying a diseased gene , so they could not have a baby .
The woman did not know the test results , but she overheard the conversation and decided to divorce her husband .
After he getting the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it said that the woman carried the diseased gene instead of the man .
At that time , the woman knew how much the husband loved her , , but she had had ruined her happiness .
Tears showed nothing .
People can not avoid carrying diseased genes , which they are are born with .
However , they can prevent the diseased genes being passed on by their children .
Telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying a diseased gene , they can make their family members bond more closely . and many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to identify and protect each individual at risk of a disorder .
However , this gives rise to a family-related ethical dilemma about regarding whether it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the right to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
It is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results . While the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequences will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and make make emotional preparations .
Take Angeline Jolie , for example . She is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing and her breast cancer risk .
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look on the bright side , with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk .
However , I believe it is just the common reaction in this situation .
In addition , in some cases the patient and the family may suffer specific discrimination in employment and their social life , which can people face as there might be dramatic tragedies such as sickness even death . ?
Life is hard but people can not call it it unfair .
It is because they are not strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good feeling , especially if the situations of other relatives becomes worse . You could feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is finally revealed , it will be more shocking and upsetting .
As a result , it is in the interests of carriers and their relatives to tell the genetic testing result
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy for each other , as well as promote awareness of the need to take care of everyone 's health .
That plays an important role in helping relatives overcome the discrimination of society and their anxiety about the risks .
In summary a , I believe that people should have an obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
It could be very difficult for them , , but necessary for the carriers and their families .
In addition , emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition are also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives , and , , if necessary , ,  guide them if they wish to conduct similar genetic test .
The Impact Of Social Media
Social media play a vitally important role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible for us to keep away from it .
I started using Facebook one year ago,when I had just arrived in Singapore
and now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and bury myself with hundreds of seeds every day .
We know each others ' status , changes and so on through social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send an SMS to each other individually any more .
Instead , we will post a and tag our friends to make it known them of change .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
In certain respects , social media have brought us quite a lot of convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking on the phone , since it is free .
We discuss everything we like and we have more personal space.Our friends also get more access to what we are doing and what we like .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public figures like celebrities and know their life better .
In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people like firefighters , police stations and so on .
Social media allow them to inform people about about what is going on .
And , actually , lots of rescue jobs are done with the help of social media , like looking for people who who are lost and so on .
With more convenient and humane communication , the relationship between the the government and the people has largely improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social media .
We can know more news and cultures through social media .
From this scope , social media have shortened the distance between us .
However , the chances and give importance of talking face to face are less because social media are so convenient , advanced and interesting .
And even if when we gather together , , most people find they have fewer topics to talk about about than before and choose to dig from their social media again .
When we are far away , social media make it as if though though we are in front of each other , sometimes , , when we are by each others ' side , we seem to be further than far away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationships not as stable , secure and reliable as before .
Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
To some extent , this makes our lives more luxurious and blundering .
Personally , I long for visit some places after I see beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes , I can not sleep well because of excitement .
Social media make our pace of life so fast , which leave us less time to think about our lives .
Social media are becoming more important and we need to think more to make them serve us better and better .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skill require practice .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt .
The burgeoning social media definitely has its benefits , but , like all good things , it is better to have it in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important aspects of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information can be readily available for their perusal .
This improves connectivity between the users .
For example , one is able to send notifications and other information we used to have in hardcopy over the web , and the process takes seconds .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately , depending on the quality of the network .
This convenience can be perceived almost in real time .
Next , communications is also greatly improved .
In the past , many communications was done by one of many means , such as as telegram , snail mail and poor-quality voice calls .
With the advent of applications such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase out most of the old communication methods .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcam can also be affixed to emulate 'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without the readily available social media .
However , it is good practice not to intensively use social media all the time .
Intimate interactions is greatly lacking in social media interactions , particularly touch .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utilises the motor , thinking and verbal cortex of the mind in .
Unlike social media , where most of the interaction is done by thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not necessarily train skills required for proper interpersonal relations .
It is also entirely wrong to blame social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences in people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a type of skill on its own - some have it , some do not .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , utilising tests , and ranked .
Fundamentally , those who score lower for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed .
Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used appropriately - for work , family andriends .
The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussions and others .
The distance between the parties must also be looked at .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use of social media is justified .
Those who live within the community should at least meet up , and not use the social media as the primary means of communication with each other .
And at the same time , this they should improve interpersonal skills , through dynamic practices between individuals and realtime presence .
The inclusion of close proximity and relative touch could also lead to a better rapport between those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media has has helped people to have a closer connection with each other . It is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face-to-face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face-to-face contact and thus negatively affect interpersonal skills .
It may even increase the chance of having face-to-face contact between people .
First , social media networks have a large user base . It and they help to link people from different parts of the world .
In the days before social networks , people did not have had the chance to know others from different countries or people they had never met before .
The number of people that they knew was only been limited to the people they met in daily life , like classmates and colleagues .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they have never knew before , and this helps to develop interpersonal skills as well .
Secondly , although social networks take time from people chatting face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in daily life .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .
For example , if a the social network did not exist , business people would need to meet each other face to face and it is time consuming . Even sometimes with business that is not so important , it still requires a lot of of time for travel , , , which is waste .
However , social networks help people to meet and chat much more easily . They can even use video chat and create a group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , some companies even conduct online video interviews with their applicants , as it saves time and money .
The social network may also create some negative impacts on people .
The biggest negative impact is , due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on the the internet all the time .
They spend too much time on using online social networks and thus do not have time to have their daily meetings with people in their real lives .
It not only affects interpersonal skills but is also is bad for people 's health if they spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social networks may leak certain personal information to the public . As the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe so people may not protect their privacy online effectively and , sometimes , some people may use other personal information to deceive .
In conclusion , despite the unsafe nature of online environments and spending too much time on the the internet being potential negative aspects of using online social networks .
, they provide people with a more convenient contact and improves the frequency of meetings with other .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than disadvantages .
The world is increasingly becoming flat as a result of all kinds of social network websites such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who lives thousands of miles away ate for lunch through these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social media media really have a lot of advantages by letting us communicate with friends more cheaply and more conveniently .
However , their disadvantages also can not be ignored when you consider them as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime .
Social network sites provide us with with a great deal of conveniences .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends by the phone , we can know their latest news by scanning the webpage .
They can help us know more about each other .
They can make people become closer as well .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singers is Justin Biber through Facebook , you can give him or her Justin Biber 's new album or a concert ticket as a birthday gift .
It will be really and you two will surely become closer .
In addition , social network sites can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without Facebook , we might have lose contact .
However , thanks to Facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they have been doing recently , as we are live close to each other .
The disadvantages of social media are quite undeniable .
Research shows that people will unconsciously hide their real thoughts when they say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading things they put on social media .
It will make them quite upset when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network , one may neglect the people surrounding one and just communicate with friends on Facebook .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk to each other but just look at their cellphones .
This kind of behaviour is not good for people 's psychological health , according to research .
Cyber communication is quite different to face-to-face communication , and people who depend on cyber communication too much will not get used to real-life communication .
In addition , cyber relationships can not always work in real life .
With no close relationships in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more likely to feel lonely because a physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others through our five senses .
With the desire of people to become the best among others , social network sites have now become a place to show off .
Some people will post their expensive things or the overseas places of interest they have been to on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
It is mentally illness and it may cause people , especially teenagers , to become materialistic .
Last but not , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is convenient for criminals to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Above all , a social network sites are like a double-edged sword and people can only take good advantage of them by avoiding the possible disadvantages by putting less personal information on their Facebook pages .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication faster than ever before .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within contemporary society , and , people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
They can even make new friends with similar interests on these platforms , who is are able to connect almost to everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions between people as they prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss both benefits and downsides of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media .
About 50 % of people learn about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than on reading newspapers .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have been made easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media have benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated is reliable .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This caused panic among people , who flooded the local police department with phone calls , and this resulted in in temporary closure schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information at a relatively fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites , despite high security control on almost every social networking movement .
Social media are able to improve relationships and help us to make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends and it would take a a relatively long time for the letter to arrive .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other conveniently .
Furthermore , it is easier to make new friends who have similar interests or hobbies .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationships as well as make new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as they may cover up their emotions while on social media .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party on social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
But , if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in contemporary society are able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects can be carefully taken care of .
All-in-all , social media are the product of rapid technological advancement and there is more to come in the future .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly facilitated long distance communication and interaction due to their accessibility and convenience .
With the globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the main platforms for social interaction .
With any media/electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with one 's friends without much hassle .
Thus , long distance relationships or friendships can be maintained and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
The sharing of personal photos , posting of the the status or one 's personal feelings or experience and the ability to reply to these posts , have , have human interaction can be engaged and expanded with ease .
Introverts , or those who are shy about communicating with their friends , are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platforms .
Thus , socialising can occur seamlessly and effectively with the use of such social media platforms.Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
Society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interaction is transformed into cyber interaction .
With the frequent use and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the Internet will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media to communicate is trust .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed can not be proven physically as media limit this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
We can not be certain of the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we receive through the Internet .
We may in actual fact be be communicating with a fake Facebook account of an online friend , which we assume to be real but , in reality , it is a fake account .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit a personal agenda .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media .
Although emoticons can be used to show certain emotions , this differs from the real emotion of your friends when you observe them through their body language and their facial expression .
The danger of such online socialising is the uncertainty of such communication due to the lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human interpersonal behaviour , since communication is conducted through social media instead of meetings .
This lowers the human ability to interact with one another , which can adversely shape one 's behaviour .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans will not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read the the news and everyone can be the first witness of what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what their friends ' recent activity is .
Nevertheless , they can still use a the phone to make a normal calls and send messages to contact people .
It is not only the phone that does jobs for them , but also devices like the personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices which are able to connect to the Internet .
It is obvious that the the Internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding whether social media actually has some inevitable disadvantages for people .
People can only use electrical devices to access the the Internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or other device .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the relevant device .
As a result , they will not have eye make contact with and hands to express their feelings to people nearby , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face communication .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
a family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because they 're holding and looking at their screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork ;
a group of friends having high tea in a caf é without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk about without clicking on their screen .
Children nowadays do not know what neighbourhood games are and who is beside them ; all they know is clicking on icons on screen .
These are some concrete examples of how social media reduce face-to-face human contact .
When people get the used to using social media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communication skills will be degraded and be be lost eventually .
Firstly , they will lose the courage to meet strangers , let alone the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people face to face and will not be trained in conversation skills .
As a result , social media help them do their jobs but indirectly affect their interpersonal skills .
Social media do have some other advantages besides their general benefits to human beings .
First of all , people save money by using the the Internet to contact other people and read the news .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in another country via social media software instead of making an an international call which costs a lot for a family on a normal salary .
He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using video calls via the Internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are are able to update their friends on their recent activity easily .
A man who is going to travelling for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activities .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that save work most of the time .
To conclusion , social media benefit people in several ways , but at the same time harm people .
People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way .
With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives proceed happily .
All of us are living in a technology realm society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect with other people ?
It started with the invention of technology , which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we travelled by ship , and now , we can use an the airplane to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we needed to post our letters and now , we can use e-mail , which stands for electronic message , to send messages to our friends or even use our mobile phone to send our messages .
From the examples that I have mentioned we can see that the distances between us and our loved ones is getting greater .
This is because with the ease of technology such as the airplane , some of our friends might go overseas to continue their studies , or perhaps you are away from your family pursuing your studies or career .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook one of the media that we need .
Nevertheless,everything in life has positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
These approach helps parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities their children do when they are overseas .
The social media are beneficial as they connects you and your loved one even though you are separated by distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family , but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
As I mentioned at the beginning , there are also disadvantages to social media tools .
One of them is that they reduces the level of concentration , especially among young people .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their Facebook page , as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This then could lead to stress , as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they are distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own lives by making the right decision .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using social media sites , but in this case , striking a balance between social media and life is the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the use of social media platforms is commonplace in our lives .
In an an increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhance and complicate the links between individuals in the world .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing about some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts on individuals ' daily lives and , therefore , becoming a big problem in society as a whole .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased .
As people feel more confident online , where they do not have to face problems real life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and , thus , prefer communicating .
This results in a a a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students , as they always have an the an option to turn their backs on real life and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their sense of self in real life and may not know how to interact with with people in real life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits of investing such enormous amounts of amounts of time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into social media , the more they seek attention from their friends .
However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short-term , so they do adding no value or meaning to the user 's life .
Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel sadder after using Facebook , and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
Social media definitely have some other strong benefits that make users stay : , and one of them , and one of them , and one of them the links between people .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the contact with friends that I want to keep .
However , friendship in such a virtual worlds is superficial , and is not relevant to real life .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies recognise the huge human traffic on such social media sites , they make it a pond to fish for for customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , , this also possibly triggers privacy issues as Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to information on the users .
As this happens , users are more and more prone to any possible fraud .
Social media sites are at their peak at the moment . However , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better people in real life , they will not indulge in them as much as they do now .
The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will get in contact with friends , no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or fall apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are created with the intention of connecting people from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people , even the older generation , will have at least one social media platform , like Facebook .
Parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and in real time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently to be connected with their so-called friends .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and in different settings .
We may meet only once but we exchange contact numbers as well as facebook accounts in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like Facebook are a great way for friends from different fields or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
Within clicks , we can check on a friend 's profile and read on for his/her updates .
On the other hand , we can update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends can read up on the newsfeed .
This allows friends that may not have the time to meet up to still be be connected in a way .
Not only that , but new friends can easily be met through such online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that makes us fall apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is the time reduction on face-to-face contact .
This subsequently leads to poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend to to send birthday wishes when Facebook prompts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send wish cards during festive seasons like Chinese New Year , and we felt so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it .
Gone are those times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
In summary , there are two sides to every coin .
The users of all social media site needs to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of their impacts on the actual life that we have .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings , and social media sites are only tools to enhance them .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 per cent of people use social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
They consist of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages that that due to social media which are of concern in society .
Therefore , this essay is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives .
First , with regard to the function of social media sites that connect people : everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and family , or even strangers , , without any time and place constraints .
Through social media sites , we can chat with our friends who are in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over a thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without travelling to the countries .
It saves a lot of money and time and strengthening our relationships although we are in different places around the world .
Besides that , the companies can also use the convenience of social media sites such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate meetings with project partners from around the world .
Substantial costs are saved without tiring travel from one point to another point .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors , which benefits companies more and boosts their profits " ) .
However , there are always two sides to every coin .
Some scholars argue that the use of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between humans .
Since ancient times , humans have been interacting with others face to face .
Without facial expression , it is easier to misunderstand a speaker 's intention .
That is why the facial expression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " . That is the point of view in society .
According to statistical reports , the more is .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
The autocorrection software is so effective when using electronic devices that we do not realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill for a person to express their feelings and opinions .
'Privacy ' has been a the most popular word is over the last few decades. recent .
Humans have their own rights and privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news about social media sites leaking users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Everything we type in social media sites is recorded on the server and then transferred to companies for spying and advertising .
Although it looks like there are no laws and it is your own space to speak in and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by government laws , but also spied on on by the government .
In conclusion , there are two sides to every story .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize the technology well , we should make an best to not only balance the pros and cons , but also to lengthen the pros and shorten the cons .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our the next generation .
With the widespread advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Getting connected on social media such as Facebook and Twitter is a main trend as well as a daily activity nowadays .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily lives .
On the one hand , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provide people with the opportunity to get in in contact with each other anytime and anywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to keep in touch by keeping writing comments .
When our phones are accidentally broken , we can also use social media to get in in in contact with our friends .
Some people who are trying to talk in public can also actively take part in group chat via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends through such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to keep up to date with friends ' statuses and contact friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to think about the influences exerted by social media .
There are still many disadvantages to using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
While social media bring convenience to people 's 's lives people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting , , , which has a time and place requirement .
People who are not good at face-to-face chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved in this situation .
Secondly , people 's addiction may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from over-dependence on virtual social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
This is a potential danger for teenagers , , who are growing , up to get hurt .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standards , as well as other show-off situations , showing off may make people 's daily lives more and more extravagant , which is not an accurate growing social trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction and their studies and work may be greatly influenced .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may still last for a long time .
Therefore , whenever we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media .
In a sophisticated era , , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
Geographical borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies have been continuously enhanced .
The telephone may have been perceived as the biggest innovation created ever the first time Graham Bell introduced it .
However , as soon as the the was introduced , the telephone has started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are offered to the user .
Let us consider the examples of Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained by telephone or mail because people 's details and addresses may change from time to time . , While on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the identifier .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chat service , personal profile , sharing medium , and other entertainment add-ons ( i.e .
social games ) which allows users to communicate with people who are far away , and also to keep up to date and express themselves at the same time .
Twitter has a more simplified functions compared to Facebook , giving more benefits if used as an information sharing medium .
Twitter only allows users to give an an updates that are limited to short sentences in order to send the word quickly , so that only highlighted messages are delivered .
With Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered , since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded and long notes can be published ; and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not recognise beforehand .
Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As a consequence , this .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say , but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may not be well arranged is a reflection of your personality .
This skill requires practice and can not be facilitated completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting pictures on Facebook , updating their their statuses on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
These social media serve the purpose : : of connecting people in spite of their geographical boundaries . , . But this should not mean that people around us are neglected as a payoff .
This is related to the interpersonal skills that have been mentioned above that decrease qualitatively as we are becoming used to facing a a gadgets , rather than facing a a human beings .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected parts of our lives , we build a a " false image " in public .
We tend to only share our happy moments on social media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problems at all .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people have a low opinion of themselves and this this this may lead to depression and mental disorders .
It also reduces our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem and it affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does not always bring advantages .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not be aware .
It is up to people 's discretion and understanding to decide what to do .
So , we should never forget to think think about the benefits and disadvantages of every decision that we make .
Nowadays , the advancement of technologies greatly improves the lives of many people .
In most countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that social media sites benefit communication between people , while some others argue that there are several negative impacts on society .
One of the advantages of offered social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In the past , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter involve some cost , and sending a letter to a person who lives far away , especially in villages , takes a lot of time .
The appearance of social media sites has caused those problems go away .
People connecting through social media sites spend no money on communication , and it it also takes only one or a few seconds for the message to arrive .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they have not seen for a very long time , such as their friends from primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from school , we probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to contact them through a phone call or a letter .
If by phone and letter were the only way to make contact , we would probably not be be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to making a the connection between us and our old friends .
Hence , social media sites serve as a platform for connection .
Everything that that comes with benefits also has its disadvantages .
social media sites also bring some negative impacts on individuals and society .
The advancement of social media sites makes people rely on them so much that some of them prefer using those sites to contact each other to talking to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought on by social media sites .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which , in turn , causes the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability of people to present their ideas well .
As a result , they gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in society .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought on on by the advancement of technology , and also learn to avoid the disadvantages and maximize the benefits of those sites .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in touch with people and the the latest news has become a tremendous demand .
Some famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
With more than a a billion from all over the world , social media sites have clearly demonstrated their success at playing an important part in our lives .
However , there are arguments that social media lead to a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which , in turn , affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives and society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All users need are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in touch with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people in real life .
Social media help to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click on the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together by allowing them to create their own groups , pages or sites to share hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global interconnected world .
However , social media sites also have their negative impacts on humans
Undeniably , it becomes more addictive when we spend more time socialising and interacting virtually .
We spend the the majority of our time on sites like Facebook and Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In the the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees spending their office time on their personal leisure rather rather than concentrating on their work .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also has effect on us in the long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend on face-to-face interaction with one another .
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between humans and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are some false reports and fake IDs on social media sites where people use IDs to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua which recently on Facebook .
These malicious comments often go viral and it has a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to unwillingness to interact with others in real life on the part of the victim .
In conclusion , there are two sides to everything and all depends on how we exploit them .
With the the booming technology , it is good that people are becoming more tech savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites . However , , this does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as this plays an even more important role in our lives .
As more and more social networks such as Twitter ,  Facebook and Weibo have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our lives , some people worry about the younger generation having problems with face-to-face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chat rooms tremendously outweigh their disadvantages .
Social media enable us to explore the world far far away without paying for expensive airplane tickets and sacrificing a one-week holiday .
The convenience is beyond description .
With a small smartphone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their lives by having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and statuses .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation makes it easier for strangers to talk to each other .
Since some information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Moreover , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their real life masks taken off .
It has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 : that 80 % of information posted online is true , while a person may lie 3 out of 10 times in real life .
This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a Facebook account .
That is because we are pretending who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes this genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh comments , we can minimize those disadvantages through strict regulation of content online .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
People around the world can easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots which happened in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy was passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
However , as the government controls most of the media ,
these social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulate the thoughts of the public .
For example , in the the 2012 general election in Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of Facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Despite this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional media .
Intensive use of social media does reduce the time people spend on face-to-face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people are sit quietly together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends right by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages in our daily lives .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
Social media sites ' roles in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thanks to those social media , communication between people all over the world is possible and can be conducted with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication without distance , many other activities such as knowledge sharing and business can be done through social media as well .
Nevertheless , despite advantages , some disadvantages may appear , such as a the reduction in face-to-face human contact , which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , as well as some fraudulent behavior that can be facilitated through social media .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through these sites , we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. On the face of it , there is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
The sharing of information can occur faster through social media as well . That is why , nowadays , many news publishers set up their own social media account . For example , Channel News Asia has a Twitter account and will update its followers with headline news .
That shows how , these days , news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without their needing to watch or listen to news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people have started doing conduct business via these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook . Whether it is our friends who are selling their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can shop things and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for us , the buyers .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them face to face ?
I do think there is a a difference and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our true feelings and may not be ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other since communication is done through written language , and thus the 'tone ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave about telling people about their opinions online , but in real life , some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to bad interpersonal skills as well as problems of trust .
Nowadays , , we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media , since we will never know whether they are even 'real' .
Some people fake their identities on social media sites so that they can know more people or some may even deceive others .
In addition , the the the the issue of privacy has become more important nowadays , since people have discovered that they may actually share some information that they were not willing to share in .
Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our lives , we should consider their drawbacks and , thus , use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and be confronted by their disadvantages in the smallest possible way .
It is a common scene to see almost everyone on public transport looking at a a phonee or wearing earphones in this modern society .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same scene .
Some say that it is a necessary step in human evolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people for connecting to others even from different countries .
However , they also bring many negative effects such as the loss of face-to-face communication skills , which are important in the work .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach others easily , even those with whom we have had little having had contact for a long time .
In the fast paced of our competitive world , people may not be be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries , funny scenes to them and on new information about their friends .
Personally , I studying overseas and a and my busy study life keeps me from contacting my old friends .
Using a common social media site with my friends helps me know what their statuses are nowadays .
Also , I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In Singapore , many Malaysians cross the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy working and separated from their children .
One of the managers in my workplace has the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
Therefore , my manager would not miss moments of her daughter 's development .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start new friendships or relationships .
People , who have the preferences , get connected .
It is easier for people to approach each other person after finding out .
Students can exchange experiences about their their studies even if if they are in different countries .
People are able to share cultures and pretty photos online . and others can spread joy to others .
Thus , I believe that social media sites are a useful tools to help people get to know each other better .
However , a social media sites are like a double-edged sword . It also has some negative effects on our daily lives .
One of the disadvantages that many people are concerned about is that people lose interest in face-to-face communication .
Many people like to use written to present , and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at personal relationships even without the existence of social media sites , we can not deny that they does affect some people 's interpersonal skills abilities .
In conclusion , everything has its downsides .
We should take advantage of the things we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed to be very useful and convenient tools to bring people closer together in this globalised world .
The use of social media has greatly influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
Online friends have become real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online .
Social media have changed our ways of exchanging information and conducting interpersonal relationships profoundly .
There are advantages and disadvantages to this change .
Social media have reshaped we communicate .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas and stories and forge friendships based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
When we use Facebook and post pictures and statuses ,
we are actively " presenting " fa ç ades of our lives to others .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks and statuses that are funny .
We broadcast these facades of ourselves to others .
The images we choose to present are carefully considered .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are just scrolling down pages of pictures and statuses and seeing one of them which they might think funny .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help with to forge interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing a friendships requires the all-round understanding of one another and caring for one another .
The latter requires face-to-face interaction , where we can show our emotions to others .
One can not truly understand a person only stalking his/her Facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
One can not truly show one 's emotions to another by texting some = ) signs .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore , because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some newspapers or public figures .
I get news about sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
If one of my friends has horrible taste in clothes and he/she posts them often , I can simply block him/her .
Information gets circulated .
The most popular information gets circulated the most , so I seldom miss it .
Social networks play a role in providing and also filtering information .
This saves a lot of time for me reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social media .
From the above two points of view , I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interests with .
I also discover some of my friends ' interests which I find in common to myself , so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each otherm , but on whatever is interesting , or the content .
In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I think social media have reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this ; , we are still not sure whether it is good or bad .
It is just different .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
People live in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults possess a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media make people to connect to with one another more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for some , that sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites has has become really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered : a group of friends met and sat around a table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enable people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with people living far away from them in the past .
It could take a few days or weeks people to receive messages .
Nowadays , all people need to do is type in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And people on the other end will only need a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer problems , which is convenient , especially when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
Social media provide people with with a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communicating .
When one chats on those media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotional delivery and even expressions are typed in None using some combinations of punctuation marks .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol ( which means laugh intensively ) and " asap " ( which means as soon as possible ) .
Indeed , people go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Therefore , when they were communicating with people face to face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes a really big problem .
Social media also provide people with with huge brunch information about people and things that interest them .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore , like famous movie and TV stars , businessmen and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their idols ' lives and works .
Up-to-date news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smartphones and laptops , at any time .
However , after one has registered on those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be of the person that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her face .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to use your information to use against you .
The fact that there is no guarantee of authenticity protects people 's information is shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media have advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily lives .
They shorten the distance between people from all over the world and make instant communication possible .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
In contrast , social media make people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and make people risk exposing their private details to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites .
How do social media help change our lives ?
With the development of continues , social media play a more and more significant role in the world .
Nobody in the world can stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and create lot of other things which helps their friends know about their lives better .
However , this also raises concerns about whether they bring us more benefits or a human disaster .
Although using social media helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , at the same time , it reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a difficult question for every human being .
Many people say they support social media since it really helps them to have a closer connection with their friends of doing in other parts of the world .
This is especially relevant true for people who are overseas .
For them , social media is the only resource they can use to know everything happening in their home countries and a platform they can use to show their lives to their loved ones as well .
What 's more , these days , , social media play an important role in spreading information .
Nowadays , people can easily put their information on their Facebook account and wait for a response from others who are from different parts of the world , , which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
It is quite significant , especially for young teenagers , since they would rather go to these sites to see news and find out about what is happening in the world rather rather than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great number of people who are are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on teenagers , who are still developing
They point out that , actually , social media reduce the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
The more we care about Facebook , the less time we have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see at looking at their phones and reading all the posts on Facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry because if all teenagers continue using social media frequently , their ability to talk to people will increase their people .
They will feel it difficult to find any topics to discuss with other people about .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media bring more disadvantages compared to the the advantages they give us .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes a lot of time as well .
Put it , if we saved the time we spent browsing on those sites more productively , , we might a books or do other more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact our family or friends .
Things might become bad if we do not know how to use social media wisely , no matter whether it is really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing them , we will all live a better life .
The advantages and disadvantages of social media
Nowadays , as technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are appearing in our daily lives .
You can see people using Facebook and Twitter , through their smartphones or iPads on buses or on trains .
Some may say that the appearance of these modern media reduces the chances for people to communicate face to face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
First , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago when these modern products were n't , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way were restricted to making phone calls , sending emails or writing letters .
Some of these forms take a a long time and some were not efficient enough for people to get their response .
However , social media solve these problems well .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get a reply very quickly .
The communication is also not limited to words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emoticons .
People can also get to know their friend 's status and mood by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in society situations and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media make people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's lives .
They make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face , such that interpersonal skills are badly affected .
Some people spend a lot of time on them and forget their real lives .
Actually , I have seen that that some people can be very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
However , they are quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers need to develop their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems with their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
Some may spend less time with their families and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the appearance of social media sites is a double-edged sword .
It can make our lives simpler .
People can develop their friendships and relationships through these social media .
However , They can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in real life and negatively affect their interpersonal skills .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages .
So we need to make the best use of these social media and make them a fun way of having some excitement when life is boring
and try to bypass the shortcomings .
And remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
People can know about their friends ' recent looks and the interesting things happening to those just by checking their Facebook or other social media sites .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly enable old friends not miss and chance to communicate with you even if if you are in a different country .
However , social media sites truly reduce face-to-face communication , which truly affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using social media in daily lives .
Firstly , social media sites can closely connect people with their friends and parents .
By typing words and showing pictures , people can express emotions that they may be too shy to express in person face-to-face .
For example , on Mother 's Day , people may be too shy to say " I love you " to their mothers , but they can type it on their mother 's Facebook pages .
Then their mothers will also receive emotion and feel warm .
On the other hand , when a are studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that they can communicate with his parents and friends .
Therefore , social media are truly good for people .
Secondly , social media sites do not only closely connect people with their friends .
People can also find out a great deal of information about celebrities from Twitter and Facebook and and get first-hand study materials on these .
They can find out how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk to them and know these famous people 's thoughts by using social media .
In addition , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who needs money to cure a disease can get help from the world quickly , because once people knows information , he she can share it with their " friends area " , then many people can find out about and spread the information to people who can give help .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the influence of social media .
Firstly , when people rely on social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they become accustomed to communicating by typing and not talking .
People even prefer to talking to their friends and meeting their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Therefore , social media truly limit interpersonal skills in such a way that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connecting face to face with their friends .
Secondly , without true communication face to face , people lose the ability to see the truth lies .
There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , but in real life , they may not have a job or they may may live poorly .
Teenagers may believe these people and be cheated and lose money , or safety .
Therefore , social media are not safe , which is bad for teenagers ' future development .
All in all , the existence of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas .
However , there exist some disadvantages which may affect people to some degree .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily lives and Society .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media have is becoming more popular , even important , in our daily lives .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook and microblog more and more frequently .
There is no need for people to go out of their homes to interact with others . They chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done or tell funny stories .
It seems that people build good relationships with others through social media , but problems arise .
People do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially strangers .
Therefore , It is importnat to examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects . It is to contact others and easier to find out about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media .
In the the old days , if one wanted to give some important news to someone who lived far away , one needed to write letters and that took time .
The long distance and delay made sending very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people did not have kept in make contact faraway friends and relatives unless there was something important to communicate .
However , people can now contact anyone in any part of the world who can use a a computer at any time , and there is no time delay to .
The other advantage is that it is easier to find out about others through social media .
